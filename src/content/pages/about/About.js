					I'm a 23 year old software developer, matheatician and musician. I currently reside in the northern suburbs of Chicago, but spent the last 4 years in Iowa where I 
					recieved my Bachelors of Science in Mathematics alongside a Minor in Computer Science from Iowa State University. I am looking for opportunities in software
					development and data; primarily where I have the ability to combine the two using my mathematics experience.
					<br /><br />
					Besides programming, I play several instruments and record/produce/mix/master music of my own. In my free time I (attempt to with the help of programming) keep up with the financial world, and expand upon my interests in general. This website was also a product of my free time,
					in attempt to branch out and accomplish something whilst learning at the same time.
					<br /><br />
					Check out some other things I have coded in the 'Experience' and 'Projects' tabs!
