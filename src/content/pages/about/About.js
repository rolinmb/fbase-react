					I'm a 21 year old software developer, matheatician and musician. I currently reside in the northern suburbs of Chicago, but spent the last 4 years in Iowa where I 
					recieved my Bachelors of Science in Mathematics alongside a Minor in Computer Science from Iowa State University. I am looking for opportunities in the software
					development and data science spaces alongside pursuing the creation of new websites for friends and family to gain more web development experience.
					<br /><br />
					Besides programming, I play several instruments but usually find a guitar in my hands. I like to write and play music as well as enjoy learning about economics, investing,
					and recently have started streaming on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rolinb">Twitch.tv</a> in my free time. With this website I intend to establish my online presence by connecting
					all the facets I choose to express myself from, which includes updating this website as my life progresses and eventually start a Youtube channel to document my journey.
					<br /><br />
					Check out some of the things I have done with software/programming in the 'Experience' and 'Projects' tabs!
